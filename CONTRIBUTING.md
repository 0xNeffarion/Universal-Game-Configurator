## Pull Requests
I will certainly accept pull requests - but I must ask that you follow a few ground rules. This is so I can keep control of the repository, and to help prevent wasting time on work that I will reject.

1. Remember that I will have to review your work. Anything you can do to help that process will be appreciated.  

2. Expect criticism.  

3. Read the [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/0xNeffarion/Universal-Game-Configurator/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) and adhere to it.
