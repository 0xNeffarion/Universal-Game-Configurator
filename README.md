# Universal Game Configurator

Software that allows you to modify configurations of a variety of games, all without needing to open the game itself.

## WIP

Project is still fresh and in development.  
Along with it, a config editor tool will be made to create data easier and faster for the UGC to use.  
Here are some early screenshots of the UI: [Game Selector](https://i.imgur.com/HQw4J7E.png) & [Configurator Window](https://i.imgur.com/cvgQ49w.png)
